        <p>We're celebrating World Lion Day with these two lion cubs in the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. The young cats may be cute and cuddly now, but they'll soon grow up to be one of the most powerful and majestic animals in the world. The predominant predator in the region, Kalahari lions cover vast territories spanning harsh shrublands and desert. Because of the scarcity of prey, Kalahari lions travel in smaller prides and often travel longer distances in search of their next meal. As of 2015, lions were listed as vulnerable and placed on the World Conservation Union Red List of Threatened Species. World Lion Day supports and promotes organizations and conservation efforts that address the dwindling wild lion population.</p>
